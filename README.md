## FRC Event Modeling:

Welcome to a project I made to help with scouting in the First Robotics Competition.  
I am a college student studying data science, and I originally made this for my old team 2106.  
While this code was originally created for the 2023 season, it has been adapted to be year agnostic, allowing (hypothetically) use for any season.

## How to Use:

1. Clone repository
2. Install [Dependencies](#Dependencies)
3. Rename `example.env` to `.env` and add your Blue Alliance api key
4. Run ```Rscript main.R {event_key}``` from the command line or in [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) 
5. Your output csv files can be found within the `output/{event_name}` directory

If you would like a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook implementation I can make one available upon request.
